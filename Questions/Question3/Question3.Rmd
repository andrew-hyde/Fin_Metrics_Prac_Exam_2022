<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

	message = FALSE,
	warning = FALSE
)
# Note: Include = FALSE implies the code is executed, but not printed in your pdf.
# warning and message = FALSE implies ugly messages and warnings are removed from your pdf.
# These should be picked up when you execute the command chunks (code sections below) in your rmd, not printed in your paper!

# Introduction \label{Introduction}

Using the information on the ALSI (J200) and SWIX (J400) top 40 Indexes, write a brief
research report in Texevier where you:

Compare the SWIX and ALSI methodologies by looking at the performance of different
size indexes (large, mid and small caps), sector exposures and stock concentration over
time. Use your discretion in writing a short report highlighting differences in the return
profiles

# The Data
I make use of the function from the practical to impute missing returns

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
    
#Using the impute_missing_returns function replace the NA with values from the same distribution
new_data_T40 <- impute_missing_returns(return_mat = T40 %>%
            select(date, Tickers, Return) %>%
            filter(date > lubridate::ymd(20080101)) %>% 
            spread(Tickers, Return),
            impute_returns_method = "Average") %>% 
            gather(Tickers, Return, -date)


T40_imputed <- left_join(T40 %>% select(-Return) %>%
                arrange(date) %>% group_by(Tickers),new_data_T40,
                            by = c("date", "Tickers"))

# neaten the data
T40_imputed$Tickers <- gsub("SJ|Equity", "", T40_imputed$Tickers)


```


# Stratification of Idexes
You may use stratification of data/usdzar.rds to provide insight into the different return profiles of both methodologies during different periods of currency performance and
volatility.

Here I reply on the courses practical notes. I begin by creating the index returns using this capped weight estimator using the tbl2xts framework. Begin by plotting the culumative returns for each index.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

graph_q3.1_func(df_data = T40_imputed,
                title = "Cumulative Returns of ALSI and SWIX Weighted Indexes",
                subtitle = "From 2008 to 2022",
                caption = "ALSI (J200) and SWIX (J400) top 40 Indexes",
                xlabel = "Date",
                ylabel = "Percentage %")

```

Break down cumulative returns by industry

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

graph_q3.2_func(df_data = T40_imputed,
                title = "Cumulative Returns of ALSI and SWIX: Financials Sector",
                subtitle = "From 2008 to 2022",
                caption = "ALSI (J200) and SWIX (J400) top 40 Indexes",
                xlabel = "Date",
                ylabel = "Percentage %")

```


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

graph_q3.3_func(df_data = T40_imputed,
                title = "Cumulative Returns of ALSI and SWIX: Industrials Sector",
                subtitle = "From 2008 to 2022",
                caption = "ALSI (J200) and SWIX (J400) top 40 Indexes",
                xlabel = "Date",
                ylabel = "Percentage %")


```



```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

graph_q3.4_func(df_data = T40_imputed,
                title = "Cumulative Returns of ALSI and SWIX: Resources Sector",
                subtitle = "From 2008 to 2022",
                caption = "ALSI (J200) and SWIX (J400) top 40 Indexes",
                xlabel = "Date",
                ylabel = "Percentage %")

```



# Capping Indexes
Answer the JSEâ€™s question on applying capping to the indexes - in particular looking at
the impact different capping levels would have had on both the SWIX and ALSI (6% and
10%). Use data/Rebalance days.rds to identify the Rebalance Days during past quarterly rebalances.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

cum_returns_q3.5_func(df_data = RebDays,
                    title = "Cumulative Returns of Capped Weighted Indexes",
                      subtitle = "ALSI (10%) and SWIX (6%), from 2008 to 2022",
                      caption = "ALSI (J200) and SWIX (J400) top 40 Indexes",
                      xlabel = "Date",
                      ylabel = "Percentage %")  


```



```{r}
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Now, to map this across all the dates, we can use purrr::map_df as follows:
Capped_df_6percent <- 
    rebalance_col %>% 
    # Split our df into groups (where the groups here are the rebalance dates:
    group_split(RebalanceTime) %>% 
    # Apply the function Proportional_Cap_Foo to each rebalancing date:
    map_df(~Proportional_Cap_Func(., W_Cap = 0.06) ) %>% select(-RebalanceTime)


```
